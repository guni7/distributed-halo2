# Demo Slides

## Intro slide, 1 liner + team details

## Halo2 Lib overview

## Problems with proof generation, previous works
- OB22 (Privacy guarantees, but no speedup, every node needs to do the same work as a single prover)
- DIZK (No privacy guarantees, but speed up in proof gen)

## Design of the proof gen system with MPC, master worker setup, semi honest security

## Core building block primitives
- MSM
- FFT
- PP (Only for PlonK)

## PSS MPC fundamentals

## Results with graphs

## Future
- TurboPlonK implementation, over the current standard Plonk
- e2e implementation (include extended witness computation)
- Get malicious security over the current semi-hones security
- Robustness against DoS attacks

## Live demo
- Trigger the FFT runner script and visualize the output in a graphs/waveforms (maybe hack it for now)

## Thank you slide with a QR code for the GitHub repo and open up for questions
